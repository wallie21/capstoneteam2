	<h2>Year One: Graduating Class of 2021</h2>
	
	

        <p>Here at APU, we have had a tradition of several years of computer science senior capstone projects centered around APU's 	CubeSat endeavors.
	The computer science senior capstone projects are the culmination of a year's worth of planning and execution geared towards 	developing a marketable website or application. 
	Students are encouraged to explore building a product that interests them, and there is always a group that does work centered 	around APU's CubeSat program as we gear up towards a 
	launch.</p>

	<h2>Exploring what's possible</h2>
	<p>The first senior project based around our program was completed during the 2020-2021 school year.
	This group set out to build software that would become the foundation of how intermediate
	or amateur radio/spacecraft enjoyers show off their data. </p>

	<ul>
		<li><h4>Step One:</h4><p>Once launched, APU's CubeSat will send telometry data from space.</p></li>
		<li><h4>Step Two:</h4><p>APU's ground station on the roof of Segerstrom (our science building) collects the 
		telometry data transmitted from the CubeSat. <a href="https://wallie21.github.io/capstoneteam2/engineering.html">

		<li><h4>Step Three:</h4><p>This collected data is sent to FoxTelem, a software tool for
		storing and analyzing telmoetry data</p></li>
		<li><h4>Step Four:</h4><p>This data is then committed to APU's database servers</p></li>
