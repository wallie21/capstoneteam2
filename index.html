        <p>CubeSats began as a collaborative effort in
	1999 between Jordi Puig-Suari, a professor at California
	Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), and Bob Twiggs, a
	professor at Stanford University’s Space Systems Development
	Laboratory (SSDL). The original intent of the project was
	to provide affordable access to space for the university sci-
	ence community, and it has successfully done so. Thanks
	to CubeSats, many major universities now have a space
	program. But it’s not just big universities; smaller universities, 
	high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools
	have also been able to start CubeSat programs of their own.<p>

	<h2>NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative</h2>
	<p>CSLI is a NASA initiative that provides opportunities
	for qualified CubeSats to fly as auxiliary payloads on future launches that have
	excess capacity or as deployments from the International Space Station (ISS). In
	very simple terms that means that NASA will cover the cost of providing your
	CubeSat a ride to space in exchange for a report on the results of your CubeSat
	investigation.</p>
		
	<p>
	About half of all CSLI missions are conducting scientific investigations, most
	frequently Space Weather and Earth Science. Specific science investigation areas
	include: biological science, study of near Earth objects, climate change, snow/ice
	coverage, orbital debris, planetary science, space-based astronomy, and heliophysics. Sixty-six percent of all CSLI missions are conducting technology development or 	demonstrations. Communications, propulsion, navigation and control,
	and radiation testing lead the topics in this area. Other notable technologies are
	solar sails, additive manufacturing, femtosatellites, and smart phone satellites.
	The low cost of development for a CubeSat allows for conducting higher risk
	activities that would not be possible on large-scale NASA missions.

	</p>

	<h3>CubeSat Designation</h2>

	<p>Let’s explain what the “CubeSat” designation means,
	compared to other small satellites. A small satellite is
	generally considered to be any satellite that weighs less
	than 300 kg (1,100 lb). A CubeSat, however, must conform to specific criteria that control factors such as its
	shape, size, and weight.</p>
		

	<p>The very specific standards for CubeSats help reduce
	costs. The standardized aspects of CubeSats make it
	possible for companies to mass-produce components
	and offer off-the-shelf parts. As a result, the engineering and development of CubeSats becomes less costly
	than highly customized small satellites. The standardized shape and size also reduces costs associated with
	transporting them to, and deploying them into, space.</p>


	<p>CubeSats come in several sizes, which are based on the
	standard CubeSat “unit”—referred to as a 1U. A 1U
	CubeSat is a 10 cm cube with a mass of approximately
	1 to 1.33 kg. In the years since the CubeSat’s inception, 
	larger sizes have become popular, such as the 1.5U, 2U, 3U, 6U, and 12U.</p>

	<h3>Launch Vehicles</h2>
	<p>Let’s talk about how the dispenser which contains your CubeSat will get
	into orbit. CSLI contracts with multiple launch services that allow CubeSats to
	hitch a ride. When the CubeSat/dispenser package was first dreamed up, the
	idea was to bolt the dispenser onto the rocket where space was available. That is
	still how most CubeSats make the journey, although there are now other options 
	available. For example, a CubeSat can be sent with
	the cargo on a resupply mission to the Space Station. The CubeSat
	would be taken aboard the Space Station and released into space in
	a specially designed deployer.</p>

	<img src="about4.png" alt="CubeSat Launches">

	<p>You also may forgo the dispenser altogether, like the Peruvian
	Chasqui 1 did in 2014. During a spacewalk, a cosmonaut released
	Chasqui 1 from the Space Station by tossing it by hand into orbit.
	There’s even a video of this online! FIGURE 6 is a still from that video.
	Keep in mind that although it has been done, this type of release is
	extremely uncommon.</p>
	

	<h3>Concept Development</h2>

	<p>Okay, first things first: What do you want your CubeSat to do? As we mentioned 
	in Chapter 1, it is important to choose a mission goal in which the CSLI, that is, 
	NASA, will be interested. You may also consider choosing a concept for which 
	it will be easy to find funding. Many CubeSat missions are designed around the 
	goals of a sponsor who will cover most of the development costs (more on that in 
	Chapter 2.2). For your best chance of being selected by CSLI, check off as many 
	“Keys to CSLI Selection” (see the “Free Advice” inset on the right) as you can.
 	There’s no real time limit to this early concept development phase. Typically, a 
	CubeSat developer will take anywhere from 1 to 6 months to plan the goals and 
	basic details of the CubeSat concept.</p>

	
 	<p>By the way, there’s no need to go it alone. Part of this conceptual development 
	time will be spent in search of possible partners and collaborators who may have 
	goals similar to your own. This is called strategic partnering, and may provide 
	you with extra funding or expertise, or both.</p>

	<h2>Building Up Towards a Launch</h2>

	<h3>Securing Funding</h3>
	
	<p> Money is very important. Once your CubeSat is selected and manifested for a 
	flight, CSLI will begin spending NASA dollars on your behalf. If you run out 
	of funds and cannot complete your CubeSat, NASA may not be able to apply 
	completed activities (“sunk costs”) to a replacement CubeSat. If this happens, a 
	launch opportunity will have been lost and it could even cause the demanifest of 
	other CubeSats co-manifested on the same launch. Additionally, the Cooperative 
	Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) that you sign with NASA after 
	being manifested requires you to reimburse NASA for any integration and launch
	 costs incurred if you don’t deliver your CubeSat on time. This hasn’t happened to 
	anyone yet, but it could! Therefore,  do not accept a launch opportunity until 
	you are confident you can deliver your CubeSat on time. As part of your proposal to 
	CSLI, you will need to provide enough budgetary information to prove 
	that you’ve secured enough funding to get you across the finish line.</p>

	<p>Designing a CubeSat around a specific mission you came up with on your own 
	may be your dream, but it may be difficult to find funding. There are, however, 
	requests for proposals (RFPs) sent out every year from organizations looking for 
	people who can help them perform missions that would be perfect for a CubeSat. 
	The National Science Foundation has funded a number of CubeSats in the past, 
	as has NASA’s Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO). A simple Internet 
	search could help you find similar organizations looking for a great team to help 
	them out. These organizations would work with your team and cover some or all 
	of the development costs. For university students interested in starting a CubeSat 
	project, another option is to inquire with faculty and administrators at your col
	lege or university. Someone there may think that funding your project would be 
	an impressive feather in the university’s cap. In addition, every state has a NASA 
	Space Grant Consortium, which provides resources in support of students pur
	suing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM.</p>

	<h3>Merit and Feasibility Reviews</h3>
	
	<p>As part of your proposal to CSLI, your team will be required to perform a merit 
	review and a feasibility review. These reviews help assure mission stakeholders 
	(and everyone else involved in the mission, i.e. CSLI, the launch vehicle provider, 
	other sponsors, etc.) that your team or organization is capable of fulfilling your 
	obligations and completing a successful and worthwhile mission. Your team will 
	organize these reviews, and you will choose the reviewers. And to make sure 
	everything is on the up-and-up, the review panel must be made up of individ
	uals who are not on the project team. For the merit review, choose reviewers 
	who have knowledge/experience with your focus area (science, technology and/
 	or education) and that can assess why a flight opportunity is required. For the 
	feasibility review, choose reviewers ideally with knowledge of space flight and 
	spacecraft, but otherwise knowledgeable in various areas of hardware and project 
	development and that can assess your team’s ability to deliver your spacecraft on 
	time and on budget. If your focus area includes science or technology, be sure to 
	include someone knowledgeable on that specific area. Keep in mind that you are 
	not just trying to check a box; you want honest, valuable, and useful feedback to 
	your objectives and design, so that you can improve your chances of a successful 
	proposal and successful mission.</p>
	
	<h5>Merit Review</h5>
	<p> Before submitting your proposal to CSLI, your CubeSat’s intended 
	mission must pass an intrinsic merit review. This review will assess 
	the goals and objectives of the mission to determine the quality of its 
	investigation in regard to science, education, and/or technology. It will 
	also determine if the overall investigation supports one or more of the 
	science, education, technology, and/or operations goals or objectives of 
	the NASA Strategic Plan. The more closely your mission aligns with a 
	goal or objective of the NASA Strategic Plan, the more likely it is that 
	your CubeSat will be selected</p>

	<h5>Feasibility Review<h5>
	<p>In addition to the merit review, your team must also complete and 
	pass a feasibility review prior to submitting the proposal. This review 
	will judge whether your CubeSat’s mission is achievable with regard to 
	“technical implementation,” including feasibility, resiliency, risk, and 
	the probability of success. Bottom line: Is this mission even possible, 
	and can your team get it done?</p>

	<h2>CubeSat Design</h2>
	
	<p>You will probably begin your design process with a lot of research. CubeSats 
	have been around for a while now, and there are plenty of developers who have 
	already made mistakes from which you can learn. Most of these developers are 
	also very open and eager to share their successes and failures with others. There 
	is plenty of material published online that may prove useful to you. We would 
	also recommend attending one of the many annual conferences where you can 
	meet and chat with members of the CubeSat community. A problem that may 
	seem impossible to you might be old hat to someone who’s been working in this 
	field for a while</p>

	<p>You will also need to research which components will work best for your CubeSat 
	system. Luckily for you, CubeSats have become increasingly popular, and the 
	availability of commercial off-the-shelf parts has vastly increased. Although most 
	popular components can now be purchased through commercial vendors, many 
	educational organizations still try to build and design as many components as 
	possible in-house in order to enhance the educational experience, as well as to 
	keep costs low. Because new companies are entering the marketplace every year, 
	we can’t give you a complete list of CubeSat component vendors, but an Internet 
	search will reveal a number of useful suppliers. A list of companies that supply 
	CubeSat components can also be found at http://www.cubesat.org on the 
	Developer Resources page. The list on this page is updated regularly, but it isn’t 
	meant to be a complete list of every vendor on the market.<.p>
