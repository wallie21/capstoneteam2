	<h2>Tuesday 12/13/2022</h2>
	<h3>Professor Marshall</h3>
	<p>I picked up our used Pumpkin Development board from Cougar Tech, which APU had purchased on eBay auction 165546144816.  Upon 	opening the box and inspecting the boards, they match what was listed.  A used Pumpkin development main board with the Pluggable 	Processor Module for a PIC24.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.pumpkinspace.com/store/p48/Development_Board_%28DB%29.html">CSK Development Board</a> - $1710</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.pumpkinspace.com/store/p127/Pluggable_Socketed_Processor_Module_E_%28PSPM_E%29.html">PSPM E</a> - $855</p>
	<p>It did not include the PIC24 processor.  I have one soldered to a module, which I could work to desolder.</p>
	<p>It was shipped well packed in a silver anti-static bag, pink bubble wrap, and bubble wrap.  It does have some shelf wear - a 	power jack is cracked, a fuse is missing, some jumpers were bent, and one corner has a ding.  But for its age it is in fine shape, 	and appears serviceable.</p>
	<p>Priority 1 is getting a PIC24 processor for it.  I can try to desolder one we bought attached to a Microchip processor module 	(Digi-key p/n <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/MA240021/2352011">MA240021-ND</a>).  Also 	APU has ordered two chips, Digi-key p/n <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/PIC24FJ256GB210-	I-PT/2352074">PIC24FJ256GB210-I/PT-ND</a>, which would just set into the 	Zero Insertion Force (ZIF) socket which Pumpkin 	supplied on the PPM, but they are backordered until circa March, estimated ship 	date 3/21/2023.</p>
	<p>I asked my friend Joe for advice on removing the PIC24FJ256GB210-I/PT from the MA240021, and he said:</p>
	<p>Luckily there are no grounding pads on the IC to give you problems, so no heat plate would be necessary.
	I would just flood the pins with flux; drag solder the ChipQuik onto the pins, and use an exacto knife to apply a slight pressure 	between the corner of the IC and the PCB. Thus breaking any surface tension and lifting the IC off the board. Then under a 	microscope I would clean the IC pins off with a desoldering wick. Or you could do the initial ChipQuik application with the 	soldering Iron, then switch off to the hot air pen to go around the pins while lightly tapping on the IC. Once you get movement on 	the IC just pluck it off the board and clean. So basically how you were planning to proceed. Easy Peasy :)
	The ChipQuik stays liquid for a long time.</p>
	<p>ChipQuik from DigiKey: <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/chip-quik-inc/REMKIT/12352150">315-REMKIT-ND</a>   	$11.95</p>
	<p>Desolder Wick from DigiKey: <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/chemtronics/80-4-5/306983">80-4-5-ND</a>   	$6.26</p>

	<p>When we are ready we can power up the boards even without a processor as a “smoke test”.  Also a next step is purchasing 	ChipQuik 	low-temperature rework solder, so I can get a PIC24 which will fit into our development board.</p>











	<h2>12/9/2022</h2>
	<h3>Professor Marshall</h3>
	<p>Pablo just returned from some time away, I inquired about the status of our order, and he said the used Pumpkin Development 		board is waiting for me in Cougar Tech (the computer store inside the Campus Store, formerly known as Cougar Byte, in what was 	formerly known as the APU Bookstore.)  (I had been checking in ECS, IMT, and the mail room, but hadn't thought to check Cougar 	Tech for the package.)</p>
	<p>I'll pick it up early next week, check it out, and leave it in the CubeSat research closet.  There is already a PIC programmer 	and adapter boards in the research closet.</p>
	<p>We had a very small amount of grant money left which needed to be spent, so I had APU purchase two PIC24 processors for the 	Pumpkin Development Board.  Digi-key <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/PIC24FJ256GB210-I-	PT/2352074">PIC24FJ256GB210-I/PT-ND</a>. </p>
	<p>They are backordered (global supply chain issues / chip shortage).  Digi-key estimates they will ship on 3/21/2023.</p>

	<h2>12/7/2022</h2>
	<h3>Professor Marshall</h3>
	<p>APU Engineering Capstone students in Spring of 2019 used two different microSD card holders on three different PCBs they 	produced for a Capstone project.</p>
	<p>I have PCBs with unpopulated footprints, and four of <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/5031821852/4693482?s=N4IgTCBcDaIKwAYDMBGAHGdcIF0C%2BQA">Molex p/n 5031821852</a> which I’ll leave in the CubeSat research room.  I’ll 	to find the p/n used on the other board.  I also grabbed a 32G microSD card that can go to the CubeSat project.</p>
	<p>Also I grabbed a 5V Switch Mode Power Supply module that I like, the OKI78SR-5/1.5W36H-C, and some barrel power jacks PH-102AH, 	probably from the DC UPS project, probably also Fall of 2018 and Spring of 2019.</p>

	<h2>12/6/2022</h2>
	<h3>Professor Marshall</h3>
	<p>Last week as Nathanael and I were reviewing the Pumpkin motherboard and the CSK 104-pin bus we noticed that Pumpkin both 	brought SPI for an SD card to the 104-pin bus, and populated a full-size SD card on their motherboard.</p>
	<p>We are thinking to incorporate a microSD card socket on our Feather/iceWerx-based development CSK motherboard, and we are 	thinking to run SPI to the stack in support of any other SPI peripherals we choose to put on other cards in the stack - 	potentially a camera on the topmost payload board.</p>
	<p>Previously Nathanael suggested a couple of connectors, below are my responses:</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/5009010801/804716">Molex 5009010801</a>-> I think we'd prefer not 	hinge type.  </p>
	<p><a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/5025700893/1866792?s=N4IgTCBcDaIKwAYxwOwJAXQL5A">Molex 5025700893</a>	</p>
	<p>-> Looks difficult to hand-solder.  Looks like the pads are down inside it</p>
	<p>I haven’t taken the time to find the part I used on a board for a consulting gig a few years ago, but looking online now, I 	think I like this part: <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/gct/MEM2080-00-128-00-A/16681105?	s=N4IgTCBcDaILIFE5gAwA4UFoVYIxjWywEEQBdAXyA">GCT MEM2080-00-128-00-A</a>.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/gct/MEM2080-00-128-00-A/16681105?	s=N4IgTCBcDaILIFE5gAwA4UFoVYIxjWywEEQBdAXyA">Digi-key</a> 2K in stock, $1.55/ea</p>

	<p>Looks reasonable to hand-solder, in stock from multiple big distributors, reasonably priced.  Push-push makes it easy to 	use.</p>
	<p>Before I remove it from my Mouser cart, documenting for posterity the $25,000 CSK-compatible motherboard that Mouser lists: 	<a 	href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/466-RH-OBC-1">Mouser P/N 466-RH-OBC-1</a> from VORAGO Technologies, their P/N RH-	OBC-1./p

	<h2>11/30/2022</h2>
	<h3>Professor Marshall</h3>
	<p><a href="mailto:ncovarrubias21@apu.edu">Nathanael Covarrubias</a> - You have the .brd file from github.  Please upload it to 	oshpark.com and they'll provide you a price to 	produce three copies.  Please e-mail me the price for standard and expedited 	fabrication.  My intention is to check in with Dr. 	Yeh.  If ECS can't cover it I may ask permission to bug Dr. Huang or 	Joshua Canada to see if CLAS can find some loose change under 	a couch cushion.  We already have the ESP32 and RISC-V Feather and 	the iceWerx, so the bare board would actually get us pretty 	far, we don't need much past that to solder and test one unit.  	(Although I'd like an RBF switch, which is $25 or such, pretty 	expensive for one fancy button.)</p>
	<p>A little more work, but once you know how, just 10 minutes, you could export the .brd design into a zip file of "gerber" files, 	and upload to Digi-Key's DKRed service and get a quote from them.  They are a little more expensive, but maybe higher quality, and 	you usually get a few free boards from them.  I sort of like that the DKRed boards are red, that's what Pumpkin uses sometimes to 	differentiate a non-flight board, a board intended only for testing/development.  See below for the steps.</p>
	<p>Please log the cost estimate to the google doc log file, and please log your work today on the PCB to the log book.  </p>
	<p><a href="mailto:ncovarrubias21@apu.edu">Nathanael Covarrubias</a>, <a href="mailto:bilau20@apu.edu">Brandon Lau</a>, <a 	href="mailto:dflorendo19@apu.edu">David Enzo Florendo</a>, <a href="mailto:sdaibyan20@apu.edu">Syuzanna Daibyan</a>, <a 	href="mailto:sjackson20@apu.edu">Stephan Jackson</a> - please use this research log 	document, and please log even avenues that 	don't pan out.  Dr. Thomas reminds us that ABET wants to see our work towards 	solutions, including the things we tried that 	didn't work or where we decided to go a different route to the final solution.</p>
	<p><b>How to export gerber files from Eagle and upload to DKRed:</b></p>
	<p>In the Eagle Board window, click File > CAM Processor…</p>
	<p>Make sure that “template_2_layer.cam” is selected at the top left, and click Process Job at the bottom right.</p>
	<img src="instruction1.jpg" alt="instruction">
	<p>Verify that your project’s directory is indicated, and click Select Folder at the bottom.</p>
	<img src="instruction2.jpg" alt="instruction">
	<img src="instruction3.jpg" alt="instruction">
	<p>In your project’s directory is a new folder CAMOutputs</p>
	<img src="instruction4.jpg" alt="instruction">
	<p>What we need for Digikey’s DKRed service are the NC Drill .xln (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCB_NC_formats">	Excellon</a>) file in DrillFiles and some of the Gerber files in 	the GerberFiles directory.</p>
	<p>To put the right files into a zip file, in Windows you can simply highlight DrillFiles and GerberFiles, right click, Send To, 	Compressed (zipped) folder.  Vola, you have a zip file with your Gerber files.</p>
	<p>Then navigate to <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/pcb-builder/?p=dkred">https://www.digikey.com/en/pcb-builder/?p=dkred</a>, 	click on </p>
	<img src="instruction5.jpg" alt="instruction">
	<p>and upload your zip file.</p>
	<p>Digikey’s tool correctly identifies the files and generates a preview, with tabs across the top for different views.</p>
	<img src="instruction6.jpg" alt="instruction">
	<p>Is it ironic that DKRed’s rendering engine shows the soldermask as green?</p>
	<img src="instruction7.jpg" alt="instruction">
	<img src="instruction8.jpg" alt="instruction">
	<p>In addition to Digi-key’s DKRed prototype service for very small quantity orders, they also provide a marketplace to let you 	compare bids from other companies to fabricate higher quantities of your boards.</p>
	<p>https://www.digikey.com/en/pcb-builder/</p>
	<img src="instruction9.jpg" alt="instruction">
	<p>Generating the Gerber files also generated a Bill of Materials (BOM) file.</p>
	<p>Look in Documents\EAGLE\projects\(your project name)\CAMOutputs\Assembly</p>
	<p>Look for a file which is the name of your board, with pcb.txt at the end.  It is a fixed-width text file.  It’s a little 	awkward, but it can be opened with Excel.</p>
	<img src="instruction10.jpg" alt="instruction">
	<p>That file includes some of the information on the parts to order to make your board.</p>
