	    <h3>Waseem</h3>

    <p>As I was not having much luck running the FreeRTOS demo in the MPLAB IDE, Professor Marshall suggested I try my luck at getting an ESP32 to run FreeRTOS in the ESP-IDF. He pointed me        to this board (I got the one with stacking headers installed):
<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3619">https://www.adafruit.com/product/3619</a></p>

   <p> I managed to get both the hello world and blink demos (which both use FreeRTOS) to run without error. The setup/installation process was not very straightforward, but these are the    resources that helped me get everything going:</p>

	<p><a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html">https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html</a></p>

	<p><a href="https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md</a></p>

	<p><a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/windows-setup.html">https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/windows-setup.html</a></p>

	<p><a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/windows-setup.html#get-started-windows-first-steps">https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/windows-setup.html#get-started-windows-first-steps</a></p>

	<p>As my hardware knowledge is pretty limited and the ESP-IDF is very new to me, I have neither managed to see where “hello world” is being printed to the console or figured out the way to connect the led to the stacking headers to get demo programs 1 and 2 to work, respectively. I will try to figure out how to do this (probably with Professor Marshall’s help). For know it’s pretty safe to say the ESP-IDF is a better environment to use going forward.</p>


	    <h2>Wednesday 3/20/2024</h2>
	<h3>Waseem</h3>

<p>As for the time being trying to program the Pumpkin Board with FreeRTOS seems to be a dead end, I’m shifting focus towards programming an ESP32 using an ESP-IDF, which has FreeRTOS integrated as a component.<p>
<p>I’ve ordered this <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3619">Adafruit ESP32 (with headers installed)</a> and downloaded the Espressif IDE and the ESP-IDF powershell. The ESP32 Should arrive in a week or so. </p>
<img src="esp32-1.jpg" alt="ESP32" style="margin-bottom: 15px">
<img src="esp32-2.jpg" alt="ESP32" style="margin-bottom: 15px">
<img src="esp32-3.jpg" alt="ESP32" style="margin-bottom: 15px">
<p>Once I have it I will try to make sure everything is working in the Arduino IDE before switching over to ESP-IDF. If I can get the ESP-IDF Hello World sample project working I will switch gears and do what I hoped to do with the Pumpkin board, which is to get several LEDs blinking and go from there.</p>

	<h2>Wednesday 3/13/2024</h2>
<h3>Waseem</h3>

<p>I spent a fair amount of time trying to get the Salvo demo application to work, to no avail. I found that a lot of important files were missing from the Salvo lite download, and the MPLAB IDE reflected in the documentation is entirely different from the one available today. For these reasons I decided to try out FreeRTOS. It has been a couple of weeks working with the demo configured for a PIC24 (albeit not the PIC24FJ256GB210 we are working with, but something similar). This demo needs a c30 compiler to run. I have not got it to run yet. I’ve been stuck at this error when trying to build: </p>

<p>make -f nbproject/Makefile-default.mk SUBPROJECTS= .build-conf
make[1]: Entering directory 'C:/Users/Wasee/OneDrive/Documents/RTOSDemo_PIC24.X'

BUILD FAILED (exit value 2, total time: 176ms)</p>


<p>I checked and the makefiles are there (I haven’t changed a thing yet). It’s discouraging that I’m running into problems running the demo right out of the starting gate, but I think I will post on the MPLAB forum to see what’s going on. </p>

<p>See CubeSat Student Research Log Fall 2022.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pumpkininc.com/space/datasheet/710-00711-B_DS_PSPM_E.pdf">Pluggable Socketed Processor Module (PSPM) E</a> board has a 6-pin 1/10” header, reference designator J3, near the modular jack.</p>

<p>Per the PSPM E Data Sheet “Customers can connect … Microchip PICKit to the PSPM's 6-pin 1x6 0.100” pitch inline header J3.“</p>

<p>So it might be as easy as plugging the PICkit4 module into the PSPM E board.  If the module standing vertically on the 6-pin header, with its attached microUSB cable is putting too much strain on the equipment, we could whip up a “Dupont” cable as a short 1:1 M-F extension.</p>

<p>For posterity the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/AC164110/1212490">Microchip AC164110</a> is another way to connect the PICkit4 and the PSPM E for ICSP programming, but seems unnecessary.</p>

<p>Prof Marshall and Waseem
We looked over the jumpers, decided on trying to power the board through USB connector J4 on the processor module, no smoke came out and the VCC light only on the development board lit up green. PICkit4 is plugged into the processor module VIA ICSP, and is powered up through Waseem’s laptop but the board (VCC) loses power. We are powering it up using both Prof Marshall and Waseem’s laptops. </p>

<p>Waseem’s computer has successfully connected to the board. Using MPLAB we got this message after clicking “Read Device Memory Main Project”:</p>

<p>Target device PIC24FJ256GB210 found.

<a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MicrochipMinutes_ep5_blink.pdf">Microchip Minutes: blink Application Lab</a> </p>

<p>Using this tutorial, (https://www.theengineertutor.com/tutorial-on-how-to-blink-a-led-using-mplab-x/) but substituting the header file to match what we are working with (it should be p24FJ256GB210.h) we got the code to successfully run in the MPLAB IDE.</p>


<p>Per <a href="https://www.pumpkininc.com/space/datasheet/710-00711-B_DS_PSPM_E.pdf">https://www.pumpkininc.com/space/datasheet/710-00711-B_DS_PSPM_E.pdf</a>
GPIO pin RF1 on the PIC24F goes to IO.24 on the Processor module, which goes to H2.24 on the Development Board.  J.R. used “dupont” jumper wires to hook the anode of a red LED to H2.24, and the cathode to a 10K resistor, which then goes to H2.30, DGND.</p>

<p>The hope is if Waseem can work out MPLab X’s pin mapping function, he can blink the LED as a hardware-hello-world.</p>

	<h2>Tuesday 12/13/2022</h2>
	<h3>Professor Marshall</h3>
	<p>I picked up our used Pumpkin Development board from Cougar Tech, which APU had purchased on eBay auction 165546144816.  Upon 	opening the box and inspecting the boards, they match what was listed.  A used Pumpkin development main board with the Pluggable 	Processor Module for a PIC24.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.pumpkinspace.com/store/p48/Development_Board_%28DB%29.html">CSK Development Board</a> - $1710</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.pumpkinspace.com/store/p127/Pluggable_Socketed_Processor_Module_E_%28PSPM_E%29.html">PSPM E</a> - $855</p>
	<p>It did not include the PIC24 processor.  I have one soldered to a module, which I could work to desolder.</p>
	<p>It was shipped well packed in a silver anti-static bag, pink bubble wrap, and bubble wrap.  It does have some shelf wear - a 	power jack is cracked, a fuse is missing, some jumpers were bent, and one corner has a ding.  But for its age it is in fine shape, 	and appears serviceable.</p>
	<p>Priority 1 is getting a PIC24 processor for it.  I can try to desolder one we bought attached to a Microchip processor module 	(Digi-key p/n <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/MA240021/2352011">MA240021-ND</a>).  Also 	APU has ordered two chips, Digi-key p/n <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/PIC24FJ256GB210-	I-PT/2352074">PIC24FJ256GB210-I/PT-ND</a>, which would just set into the 	Zero Insertion Force (ZIF) socket which Pumpkin 	supplied on the PPM, but they are backordered until circa March, estimated ship 	date 3/21/2023.</p>
	<p>I asked my friend Joe for advice on removing the PIC24FJ256GB210-I/PT from the MA240021, and he said:</p>
	<p>Luckily there are no grounding pads on the IC to give you problems, so no heat plate would be necessary.
	I would just flood the pins with flux; drag solder the ChipQuik onto the pins, and use an exacto knife to apply a slight pressure 	between the corner of the IC and the PCB. Thus breaking any surface tension and lifting the IC off the board. Then under a 	microscope I would clean the IC pins off with a desoldering wick. Or you could do the initial ChipQuik application with the 	soldering Iron, then switch off to the hot air pen to go around the pins while lightly tapping on the IC. Once you get movement on 	the IC just pluck it off the board and clean. So basically how you were planning to proceed. Easy Peasy :)
	The ChipQuik stays liquid for a long time.</p>

	<p>When we are ready we can power up the boards even without a processor as a “smoke test”.  Also a next step is purchasing 	ChipQuik 	low-temperature rework solder, so I can get a PIC24 which will fit into our development board.</p>











	<h2>12/9/2022</h2>
	<h3>Professor Marshall</h3>
	<p>Pablo just returned from some time away, I inquired about the status of our order, and he said the used Pumpkin Development 		board is waiting for me in Cougar Tech (the computer store inside the Campus Store, formerly known as Cougar Byte, in what was 	formerly known as the APU Bookstore.)  (I had been checking in ECS, IMT, and the mail room, but hadn't thought to check Cougar 	Tech for the package.)</p>
	<p>I'll pick it up early next week, check it out, and leave it in the CubeSat research closet.  There is already a PIC programmer 	and adapter boards in the research closet.</p>
	<p>We had a very small amount of grant money left which needed to be spent, so I had APU purchase two PIC24 processors for the 	Pumpkin Development Board.  Digi-key <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/PIC24FJ256GB210-I-	PT/2352074">PIC24FJ256GB210-I/PT-ND</a>. </p>
	<p>They are backordered (global supply chain issues / chip shortage).  Digi-key estimates they will ship on 3/21/2023.</p>

	<h2>12/7/2022</h2>
	<h3>Professor Marshall</h3>
	<p>APU Engineering Capstone students in Spring of 2019 used two different microSD card holders on three different PCBs they 	produced for a Capstone project.</p>
	<p>I have PCBs with unpopulated footprints, and four of <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/5031821852/4693482?s=N4IgTCBcDaIKwAYDMBGAHGdcIF0C%2BQA">Molex p/n 5031821852</a> which I’ll leave in the CubeSat research room.  I’ll 	to find the p/n used on the other board.  I also grabbed a 32G microSD card that can go to the CubeSat project.</p>
	<p>Also I grabbed a 5V Switch Mode Power Supply module that I like, the OKI78SR-5/1.5W36H-C, and some barrel power jacks PH-102AH, 	probably from the DC UPS project, probably also Fall of 2018 and Spring of 2019.</p>

	<h2>12/6/2022</h2>
	<h3>Professor Marshall</h3>
	<p>Last week as Nathanael and I were reviewing the Pumpkin motherboard and the CSK 104-pin bus we noticed that Pumpkin both 	brought SPI for an SD card to the 104-pin bus, and populated a full-size SD card on their motherboard.</p>
	<p>We are thinking to incorporate a microSD card socket on our Feather/iceWerx-based development CSK motherboard, and we are 	thinking to run SPI to the stack in support of any other SPI peripherals we choose to put on other cards in the stack - 	potentially a camera on the topmost payload board.</p>
	<p>Previously Nathanael suggested a couple of connectors, below are my responses:</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/5009010801/804716">Molex 5009010801</a>-> I think we'd prefer not 	hinge type.  </p>

	<p>-> Looks difficult to hand-solder.  Looks like the pads are down inside it</p>
	<p>I haven’t taken the time to find the part I used on a board for a consulting gig a few years ago, but looking online now, I 	think I like this part: <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/gct/MEM2080-00-128-00-A/16681105?	s=N4IgTCBcDaILIFE5gAwA4UFoVYIxjWywEEQBdAXyA">GCT MEM2080-00-128-00-A</a>.</p>

	<p>Looks reasonable to hand-solder, in stock from multiple big distributors, reasonably priced.  Push-push makes it easy to 	use.</p>

Please upload it to 	oshpark.com and they'll provide you a price to 	produce three copies.  Please e-mail me the price for standard and expedited 	fabrication.  My intention is to check in with Dr. 	Yeh.  If ECS can't cover it I may ask permission to bug Dr. Huang or 	Joshua Canada to see if CLAS can find some loose change under 	a couch cushion.  We already have the ESP32 and RISC-V Feather and 	the iceWerx, so the bare board would actually get us pretty 	far, we don't need much past that to solder and test one unit.  	(Although I'd like an RBF switch, which is $25 or such, pretty 	expensive for one fancy button.)</p>
	<p>A little more work, but once you know how, just 10 minutes, you could export the .brd design into a zip file of "gerber" files, 	and upload to Digi-Key's DKRed service and get a quote from them.  They are a little more expensive, but maybe higher quality, and 	you usually get a few free boards from them.

	<p>Generating the Gerber files also generated a Bill of Materials (BOM) file.</p>
	<p>Look in Documents\EAGLE\projects\(your project name)\CAMOutputs\Assembly</p>
